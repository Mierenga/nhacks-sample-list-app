# nhacks-BasicListApp

This is the project for the Android Workshop at NHacks III (https://nhacks.org/)

There is both a Kotlin and Java version of the MainActivity for reference.

To follow along in Kotlin, you will need to comment out the JavaMainActivity.java file by selecting all of the text and using the line comment feature (mac: `command`+`/`, windows: `ctrl`+`/`). Otherwise, it will confuse the compiler.

The slideshow from the workshop is also inlcuded in this repository.
